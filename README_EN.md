## Controlling PowerPoint presentations using Kinect

## üìÑ Summary
This repository contains a complete solution for controlling PowerPoint presentations using the Kinect, a motion sensing device developed by Microsoft. The solution includes a desktop application in C# that is responsible for communicating with the Kinect, processing motion data and sending commands to PowerPoint.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features.
+ Controls PowerPoint using corpolar gestures as well as voice commands.
+ Works on Windows 10 and later versions.
+ Support for Microsoft Kinect SDK.
